# Servo-PanTilt-PiCam
I decided to make a Pan-tilt Servo mount for the Raspberry Pi Camera. It is ment for the common 9g servos. I first thought of this to use in Paul McWhorter's Raspberry Pi class, put know maybe I might use it in a few of my own projects as well. I've included all the 3D Models and code. Use this however you like! Enjoy!

First, print out the cad files. 
Then I got one of my servos, and put it in the quadropod mount where the wires are facing the back \(the front is where the 2 legs point forwards\). I then screwed it in with the 2 long screws servos come with. 

Then I programmed the servo to be at 90 degrees because now we put the horn \(the 2 sides one\). I customized this horn \(trimming about 1-2 millimeters from either end and driling a wider hole\) to fit in the horn slot in the servo mount. The slot in the servo mount is too small for this horn. I screwed in the horn.
