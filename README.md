# Servo-PanTilt-PiCam
I decided to make a Pan-tilt Servo mount for the Raspberry Pi Camera. It is ment for the common 9g servos. I first thought of this to use in Paul McWhorter's Raspberry Pi class, put know maybe I might use it in a few of my own projects as well. I've included all the 3D Models and code. Use this however you like! Enjoy!

First, print out the cad files.
